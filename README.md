This project builds an [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) docker image
from scratch using the upstream filesystem image. The official Alpine images
on docker hub can lag a little behind the official releases. I would prefer
that my base image is up to date with the latest version of all packages.

The build script adds a user called "worker". The Dockerfile uses this user so
your workload isn't running as root in the container.

Each build is checked for vulnerabilities using [Aqua Security's
trivy](https://www.aquasec.com/products/trivy/).

If you're worried about your docker image supply chain I recommend you fork
this repo or use it as inspiration for your own project. This should allow
you to be confident that you are using the latest version of Alpine Linux
with all available updates. I am not suggesting that these images are secure.
You need to do your own homework on that.

## Required Variables

You must configure the following environment for the build to work:

* `DOCKER_USERNAME` - Your Docker Hub username
* `DOCKER_PASSWORD` - Your [Docker Hub access token](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/) (or password)

## Support
I will maintain this while I am using images based off it on a best effort
basis. If you don't understand what's happening in the scripts, then I
recommend you use the official images.
